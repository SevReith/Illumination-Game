    "light bulb": "The first attempts to create light using electricity date back to 1802. It should take until \nthe 1870s until the invention finally became economically viable. Even though these early\nlight bulbs were far from reliable, they offered many advantages over previous light\nlight sources. They did not smoke or stink and most importantly were much less prone to\nfires.\nLight bulbs consist of tungsten filament, connected to two lead-in wires. These wires\nare connected to a base or socket. The socket provides the electricity inlet as well as the\nmechanism to hold them in place. The base is usually shaped like a screw. The filament\nis protected by a glass bulb filled with protective gas or a vacuum. The protective gas\nprevents the filament from burning out too fast and especially keeps the glass from\nbecoming black.",
