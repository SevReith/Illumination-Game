    "light bulb": "The first attempts to create light using electricity date back to 1802. It should take until the 1870s until the invention finally became economically viable. Even though these earlylight bulbs were far from reliable, they offered many advantages over previous light sources. They did not smoke or stink and most importantly were much less prone to fires.\nLight bulbs consist of tungsten filament, connected to two lead-in wires. These wires nare connected to a base or socket. The socket provides the electricity inlet as well as the mechanism to hold them in place. The base is usually shaped like a screw. The filament is protected by a glass bulb filled with protective gas or a vacuum. The protective gas prevents the filament from burning out too fast and especially keeps the glass from turning black.",
