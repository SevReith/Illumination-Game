Game Situation
Don't we all dream of this distand relative, noone has ever heard of, that suddenly dies
and we find us in the fortunate situation to be their lucky heir?
Dream no longer! As the official note you're just holding in your hands says, you had a cousin
of 5th degree, who recently passed away without an heir. That is: without any heir but you!

Apparently he owned an entire factory that produced light bulbs. And all of a sudden youn are 
a business man now! Of course you immediately pack your luggage and travel to your new factory!

In large letters over the main gate you read the name of the your facoty: Illumination Factorium.
However the disentchantment follows soon. The factory is far from it's best state. The most part
of the large building stands empty. Only one working space is suitable for production. And it is
a basically a fixed position layout! Cheap... but probably not best suited for a mass produced good
like a light bulb. 

The old production manager shows your around. And despite the desparate state of the factory, you cannot
but see potential! There is even a small amount of cash available. Of course your new employees watch
every single of your steps. Is it that hope you can see in their eyes?

Production
You own one operational Fixed Position Layout with enough machines and workers. It is rather cheap in
setup, but also not very efficient in production. Your late cousin had this thought as well and had 
expansion plans. Sadly he only managed to enlarge the production hall to thrice the currently used
size, before he died. At least you have plenty of room for expansion now. Also the stock is relatively
well filled with about 1000 light bulbs and enough raw materials for another 1000.

Accounting
Well, you have 10000� in cash. Thats pretty much it. You need to make smart decisions to turn this into
a fortune. Otherwise it will be gone as quickly as you got it. At least with a new owner the banks might 
be more willing to give new credits.

Market
The entire european illumination market is estimated to measure about 9 billion � per year.
Our sales department is confident, that we could serve 0.0019% of the entire volume. That is not a lot.
Given the run down state of the company, this is seems to be a rather bold statement nontheless.
However the news of a new, young and hungry owner might not only spur the sales team and actually every
single employee of our small family business. It might be the needed spark to restart relations
with customers!
A strong fresh wind seems to blow through the Illumination Factorium!
